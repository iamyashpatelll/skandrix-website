**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB backend. The frontend is substantially built out, reflecting the Skandrix brand's minimalist and premium aesthetic. It includes the Core (Home), Startups, and Connect pages, along with a functional header and footer. The Technology page has a dropdown menu that leads to templated individual service pages. Mobile responsiveness has been a key focus, with several iterations to fix layout issues and improve the navigation menu. An animated counter for metrics is implemented on the homepage. The basic frontend files and routes for an Admin Panel also exist but are not connected to any backend logic.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The user's latest request is to fix the mobile navigation for the Technology page. In the mobile menu, the user wants to click on Technology to reveal a dropdown of services. The user also mentioned wanting an easy to navigate swipe experience, which is a new requirement that needs clarification. The agent has not started implementing this fix yet.
-   Status: NOT STARTED
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent

    -   Next debug checklist:
        -   Modify .
        -   Implement state management (e.g., ) to control the visibility of the services dropdown within the mobile menu.
        -   Attach an  event handler to the Technology menu item (on mobile) to toggle the dropdown's visibility.
        -   Ensure the desktop  /  hover behavior is not affected.
        -   Clarify the user's request for swipe navigation using the  tool before implementation.
    -   Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is a critical usability issue. Fixing it will make the full range of the company's services accessible to mobile users, which is essential for a mobile-first design.
